# Rebuild
A turn based survival Game. You are the leader of a lost civilization in a city overrun by zombies. You are tasked with rebuilding the your society and restoring order to your township.

Each turn you would have certain resources (people with different roles) to either scavenge for food in nearby tiles, recruit the survivors in unfriendly tiles, kill zombies in adjacent tiles to your territory, or use workers to reclaim the tiles that are zombie free. 

As you fend of zombie attacks by training soldiers you also must make sure you have enough man power and food. The only way to continue to defend against the attacks is to expand your territory and build schools (to train your new labor), famrs (to feed your people), and police stations (to strengthen your defense)

As leader, you have to endure the hardships of this broken world. 

Good Luck.
